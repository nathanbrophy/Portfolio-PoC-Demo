k8s is a sample operator controller that will reconcile a CRD definition with boilerplate information to standup an application on a k8s cluster. 

## Description

The operator in this repository has a few key components:

1. Controllers
2. APIs
3. DriftDetection
4. Generators

### Controllers

Holds a collection of tests and functions to act as the operator controller, that runs in the manager to reconcile the cluster state.

### APIs

Holds a collection of API versions that implement the overall `Application` API, that is used in reconciliation to generate the correct downstream manifests.  Currently, only `v1beta1` is a supported API version.

### DriftDtection

Holds a collection of boolean functions to test two objects for drift.  This is used to determine if reconciliation needs to be ran for a generated object, or if the cluster state is at parity with the expected state.

### Generators

Holds a collection of kubernetes object generators that are used to derive the downstream manifests needed to deploy the application from the CR coolected from the cluster. 

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/k8s:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/k8s:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

The controller also has an [e2e](./e2e/) test suite that can be ran to prove out integration functionality of the reconcile logic.  

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
